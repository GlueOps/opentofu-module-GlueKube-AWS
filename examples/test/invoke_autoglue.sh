# Invoke an AutoGlue action against the cluster created by `tofu apply`.
#
# Resolves the cluster id by name, finds the action id by its make target, then
# triggers an action run (this is the "kubernetes setup" invocation). Called by
# the test-apply workflow after apply. Requires `curl` and `jq` on PATH.
#
# Required environment variables:
#   BASE_URL            AutoGlue API base url
#   API_KEY             AutoGlue API key            (sent as X-API-KEY header)
#   ORG_ID              AutoGlue org id             (sent as x-org-id header)
#   CLUSTER_NAME        Name of the cluster to look up
#   ACTION_MAKE_TARGET  make_target of the action to run (the k8s setup target)
